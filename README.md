# In this project, for text extraction, we need to detect and recognize the regions of the text on an Aadhaar image using YOLO and Tesseract.
# Steps in YOLO Training using Darknet Framework
# Collect data (Aadhaar images)
# Annotate data using LabelImg (Image annotation tool)
# Use YOLO configuration file and pre-trained YOLO weights to converge our model
# Use Tesseract OCR for text recognition.
