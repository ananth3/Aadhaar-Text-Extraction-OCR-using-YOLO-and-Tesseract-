In this project, for text extraction, we need to detect and recognize the regions of the text in Aadhar images using YOLO and Tesseract.
### Steps in YOLO Training using Darknet Framework
- Collect data (ID proofs images)
- Annotate data using LabelImg (Image annotation tool)
- Use YOLO configuration file and pre-trained YOLO weights to converge our model
### Use Tesseract OCR for text recognition. 
- Tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool which is used to recognize and extract text from images.
